# Flask Webhook Server with OpenAI LLM Integration (Techstax Assignment)

This repository contains a lightweight Flask server that handles incoming POST webhooks (typically from GitHub Actions) and processes the payload using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 model via API.

It is designed to work alongside the action-repo, which triggers the webhook on every push.
